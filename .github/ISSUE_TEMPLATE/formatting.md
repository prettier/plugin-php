BEFORE SUBMITTING AN ISSUE:

1.  Search for your issue on GitHub: https://github.com/prettier/plugin-php/issues
    A large number of opened issues are duplicates of existing issues.
    If someone has already opened an issue for what you are experiencing,
    you do not need to open a new issue — please add a 👍 reaction to the
    existing issue instead.

2.  We get a lot of requests for adding options, but Prettier is
    built on the principle of being opinionated about code formatting.
    This means we have a very high bar for adding new options.
